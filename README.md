## AI Assistant Interaction Guidelines

### Incremental Change Policy

When working with this codebase, AI assistants must:

- **Make small, targeted changes only** - Focus on specific components or features
- **Do not rewrite or refactor large sections** - Preserve existing architecture
- **Preserve all existing trading functionality** - Don't remove features
- **Ask before modifying core components** - Get explicit approval for significant changes
- **Build upon existing code patterns** - Maintain consistency with the codebase
- **Document all changes clearly** - Explain what was modified and why

### Critical Code Areas (Do Not Modify Without Approval)

- Trade simulation logic
- Chart rendering and visualization components
- Data structures for trades and market data
- Navigation and screen architecture
